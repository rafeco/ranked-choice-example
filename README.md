# ranked-choice-example

Generate ranked choice ballots and tabulate them.

To try it out, just download it and run the `election.sh` script. You can also 
pass a vote count to the script to conduct an election with a specific number of 
ballots. The candidates are hard-coded in `generate_votes.py`.

Requires Python 3 and SQLite 3.
